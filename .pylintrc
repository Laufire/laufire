[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# C101: Line too long (skipped due to the adoption of a different convention).
# C0111: Missing docstring. (Skipped to avoid unnecessary clutter).
# C0103: Invalid name (skipped due to the adoption of a different convention).
# C0301: Line too long (skipped due to the adoption of a different convention).
# C0303: Trailing whitespace (not used as a way to trim trailing white spaces isn't found, yet).
# C0325: Unnecessary parens after %r keyword (asserts are written as functions).
# C0330: Wrong hanging indentation. (skipped due to the adoption of a different convention).
# C1001: Old-style class defined (skipped due to the adoption of a different convention).
# E0211: Method has no argument (We use ec, which doesn't have a "self" argument on its methods used for group tasks).
# E0213: Method should have "self" as first argument (We use ec, which uses static methods as tasks).
# E0611: No name '' in module '' (pylint can't process the module win32 and related modules).
# E1101: Module '' has no '' member (pylint can't process the module win32 and related modules).
# E1103: Instance of '...' has no '...' member (buggy: but some types could not be inferred).
# E1120: No value passed for parameter '...' in function call (pylint can't comprehend decorators).
# E1121: Too many positional arguments for function call (the helpers.@namespace needs the decorated to have no arguments).
# F0401: Unable to import '' (pylint can't process the module win32 and related modules).
# I0011: Locally disabling (access to protected members are needed in some cases).
# R0201: Method could be a function (some classes are used only outside of the defining script).
# R0401: Cyclic import (we really need some).
# R0903: Too few public methods (some classes are used as Data structures).
# R0912: Too many branches (there are a few monoliths that have to have a lot of branches).
# R0913: Too many arguments.
# R0914: Too many local variables.
# R0915: Too many statements (there are a few monoliths that have to have a lot of statements).
# W0142: Used * or ** magic (a lots of magic is used).
# W0232: Class has no __init__ method (We use ec, which uses classes as groups).
# W0311: Bad indentation. Found 2 spaces, expected 4 (skipped due to the adoption of a different convention).
# W0312: Found indentation with tabs instead of spaces (skipped due to the adoption of a different convention).
# W0401: Wildcard import.
# W0403: Relative import 'module', should be 'package.module' (some initializing scripts need to imported relatively).
# W0603: Using the global statement (some times it seems to be necessary).
# W0611: Unused import.
# W0614: Unused import from wildcard import.
# W0621: Redefining name from outer scope (the implementation is buggy, it doesn't consider the global statement).
# W0622: Redefining built-in (buggy: it disallows keyword arguments being named after built-in types).
# W0633: Attempting to unpack a non-sequence (buggy).
# W0702: No exception type(s) specified (all the exceptions should be caught).
# W0703: Catching too general exception (even the most generic exception should be caught).
# W1201: Specify string format arguments as logging function parameters (it's just one more thing to remember).
