=======

	A set of modules to help with ops.

Idea
----

* The idea is to have a sharable, utility module across the projects to save on development and debugging time.


Modules
-------
* **extensions.py** - provides generic low level functions to assist development.

* **filesys.py** - helps with handling the filesystem tasks.

* **logger.py** - meant to be the provider of logging functionality.

* **shell.py** - helps with dispatching commands through the shell.

* **sqlitex.py** - a simple wrapper over the native sqlite3 library.

* **yamlex.py** - helps with handling yaml-s.

ToDo
----

* Add all possible modules.

Pending
-------

* Make the package as publishable.
